    <h1>Reverse Tic-Tac-Toe</h1>
    <p><strong>Description: </strong>
      Reverse Tic-Tac-Toe is a competitive game where humans play against an AI opponent. The AI employs 
      the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm, enabling it to make strategic moves and frequently outmatch human players. 
      It effectively guides opponents into unfavorable positions while skillfully defending against potential threats.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Technology: </strong>Visual Studio Code, C++</p>
    <p><strong>Challenges: </strong><br>
      Implementing the alpha-beta pruning algorithm for the AI player was quite challenging. One drawback of the game is 
      that the player almost always loses, as the AI, utilizing the alpha-beta pruning algorithm, counters the player's 
      moves and guides them toward failure.
      <br /><br />
      In the future, I plan to expand the game grid to provide a greater challenge for both players and the AI. A larger grid 
      would introduce additional complexity, requiring more advanced strategies for both offense and defense. I also aim to 
      implement a random board generator, ensuring that each game begins with one move from the player and one from the AI 
      already placed. This would add variety to the gameplay by creating unique starting configurations, making each game feel 
      fresh and reducing repetition. Moreover, it could offer players more opportunities to win, helping them better understand 
      the game’s mechanics and improve their decision-making skills.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Outcome: </strong>
      At the start, I considered using either the Minimax Algorithm or the Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithm. I chose Alpha-Beta 
      Pruning because it’s more efficient. While Minimax evaluates every possible move, Alpha-Beta Pruning skips over 
      unnecessary options, allowing it to achieve the same results faster. This makes Alpha-Beta Pruning a better choice, 
      especially if I decide to improve the game later. It can look further ahead in the game within the same amount of time, 
      helping it make smarter decisions in more complex situations. With this approach, the Reverse Tic-Tac-Toe AI played 
      very well, making smart moves and defending effectively against the player. Overall, the implementation was successful, 
      and the AI consistently performed better than human players.
