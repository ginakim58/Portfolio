    <h1>Run Bubble!</h1>
    <p><strong>Description: </strong>
      Run Bubble! is a 2D game targeted at Windows users, inspired by New Super Mario Bros. The objective is to defeat 
      enemies, collect as many coins as possible, and reach the flag without dying or running out of time. Checkpoints 
      allow the player to respawn if they die while battling enemies or navigating traps.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Technology: </strong>Unity, C#</p>
    <p><strong>Challenges: </strong><br>
      During the development of this game, I encountered a few challenges. One of the main issues was implementing a 
      moving platform. I wanted the player to be able to stand on the platform and move with it, but initially, 
      only the platform moved while the player kept falling off. After watching several tutorials, I learned that 
      in order for the player to move with the platform, the player needed to become a child of the platform upon collision.
      <br /><br />
      Another challenge was adding hills and dips to the environment. I wanted the player to naturally move up and down with 
      the terrain, but whenever the player encountered a hill or dip, they would fall off and end up behind the platform. 
      To solve this, I added an invisible box collider beneath the player, allowing them to stay on top of the terrain and 
      move smoothly over hills and dips.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Outcome: </strong>I was able to build and run the 2D platformer game successfully, without any issues.</p>
