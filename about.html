      <h1>So, Who Am I?</h1>
      <h2>Computer Science Student</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a senior at California State University, Fullerton, set to graduate in December 2024. 
        Over the past three years, I’ve immersed myself in coding, working with languages like 
        C++, C#, Python, and JavaScript. I’ve also explored various electives to discover my 
        interests and define the career path I plan to pursue after graduation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, I’ve been actively working on several projects, including my senior capstone, 
        AI-driven applications, and a platform game. These experiences have sharpened my technical 
        skills and deepened my passion for solving real-world problems through programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the languages I’ve worked with, I’m most comfortable with C++ and Python. I began 
        my coding journey with C++, which built a strong foundation, and later picked up Python 
        in my second year, appreciating its simplicity and versatility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of coding, I enjoy playing guitar, exploring video games, and creating DIY projects 
        with Raspberry Pis. These hobbies let me balance creativity with problem-solving and keep me 
        energized both in and out of the tech world.
